#You embed variables inside a string by using a special {} sequence and then put the
#variable you want inside the {} characters. You also must start the string with the letter f for ”format”,
#as in f"Hello {somevar}" . This little f before the " (double-quote) and the {} characters tell Python
#3, ”Hey, this string needs to be formatted. Put these variables in there.”
